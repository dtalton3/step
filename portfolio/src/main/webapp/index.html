            <h3>
                "Hay, my name ih Dehmun Taltun"
            </h3>

            <p>
                Since I've been in college at Georgia Tech, I've been teased for my dialect. <br>
                I am from Macon, Georgia (which is a city, but I guess its the country in the middle of nowhere) and 
                that's just how we talk down here. <br> 
                From the slang and "lingo" I employ to the southern drawl I deliver it with, the way I talk is just 
                something that makes me... me. In my opinion, the way I talk is the best way to go about communicating,
                so you can tease me about it. I am not insecure of it. 
            </p>

            <h4>
                Something I was insecure about, though, was my weight
            </h4>

            <p>
                For most of my life I was pretty obese. I had always been a big guys and say it as an inevitability, but
                I never liked it. I felt like my size was the first impression that characterized who I was before I got 
                the opportunity to do so.
            </p>

            <p>
                ... That's not how it actually works <br>
                                                    ... but thats how I saw it at the time.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2019, I finally decided to take control of my situation. I changed my diet and started to be a 
                lot more active.
            </p>

            <p>
                Honestly, I feel its my biggest accomplishment to date. I am not satisfied yet, though. I feel I could 
                still lose some more weight, but I definitely have a healthier view of my self-image. <br>
                While, in hindsight, it doesn't make sense (most insecurities never do, to be honest), this really opened 
                the door to make me feel like I can be more of myself.
            </p>

                So... who am I, really?
            </h3>

            <p>
                My name is Desmond Talton. I am a rising 3rd year Computer Science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
                I am particularly interested in web app development on the front and back end. Overall, I am just a guy who enjoys 
                having fun and being creative.
