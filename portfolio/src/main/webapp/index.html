            I've been in college at Georgia Tech, I've been teased for my dialect. <br><br>

            I am from Macon, Georgia (which is a city, but I guess its the outback country in the middle of nowhere) and 
            that's just how we talk down here. <br><br>

            From the slang and "lingo" I employ to the southern drawl I deliver it with, the way I talk is just 
            something that makes me... me. In my opinion, the way I talk is the best way to go about communicating.

            <strong>Something I was insecure about, though, was my weight</strong><br><br>

            For most of my life I was pretty obese. I had always been a big guy and saw it as an inevitability, but
            I never liked it. I felt like my size was the first impression that characterized who I was before I got 
            the opportunity to do so.

        <p>
            In 2019, I finally decided to take control of my situation. I changed my diet and started to be a 
            lot more active.
        </p>
        <p>
            Honestly, I feel its my biggest accomplishment to date. I am not satisfied yet, though. I feel I could 
            still lose some more weight, but I definitely have a healthier view of my self-image. <br>
            While, in hindsight, it doesn't make sense (most insecurities never do, to be honest), this really opened 
            the door to make me feel like I can be more of myself.

            My name is Desmond Talton. I am a rising 3rd year Computer Science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
            I am particularly interested in web app development on the front and back end. Outside of my "professional" life,
            I enjoy being around my enjoying laughs with my friends and being creative on my own means.
